                    Brandon utilizes a new branch of Astrology called Evolutionary Astrology, which views the Astrological Birth Chart
                    as a “window to the soul” and, through this perspective, is able to determine the “intentions” the soul has when
                     entering into this life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this Astrology can help you explore, in depth:
                </p>
                <ul>

                    <li>The Skills that you have to help make you money</li>

                    <li>How to heal from your life traumas</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="servicesBlueSmallHeader">Astrology Session</p>
                <p>
                    In this session you get:
                </p>
                <ul>

                        any/all insights into who you are and what you’re here to do
                    </li>

                    Socrates, the famous philosopher, said: “Knowing thyself is the beginning of all wisdom.”
                </p>    
                <p>
                    I believe Evolutionary Astrology is one of the BEST ways to achieve this goal. Whether you have specific
                    questions or want to KNOW THYSELF better than you ever have before, Astrology can help you.

                            Brandon is incredible at what he does! I came to him at a time when I was feeling nervous and uncertain of
                            my path. He was very detailed, kind, and insightful. What I found most remarkable about his talent was his
                             ability to identify specific details about my gifts without prior knowledge of my lifestyle or common
                              professional connections. For example, Brandon mentioned that my birth chart indicated I have the potential
                               to succeed in politics. Ironically, I have worked on many campaigns and almost attended law school prior
                                to completing my MBA.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, we discussed the decision to move into a corporate role as an analyst. Brandon mentioned that
                            if I took this path, I would be quickly promoted. However, my chart indicated that I would likely 
                            transition to a training or leadership role that would allow me to utilize my natural teaching abilities.
                             Days later, I was offered a role in training and development following a short presentation. I didn't see
                              that coming, as I don't present often!
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            If you are looking for a unique way to discover untapped career potential, curious about your purpose,
                             or interested in hiring a great motivational speaker, you can’t go wrong booking Brandon Tobias.
