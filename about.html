                    Brandon is a certified Health and Performance Coach and Lead Health Strategy Advisor for several top Regenerative
                     Wellness Clinics throughout the U.S. In 2012 Brandon suffered from a debilitating knee surgery that left him 
                     with rampant and sudden health disorders, seemingly “incurable” by western medical standards. This led him
                      to find real solutions and “cures” to his health issues by studying nutrition, exercise/movement, Ayurvedic
                       medicine, and regenerative/functional medicine and “Biohacking.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    After transforming his life through his health, Brandon has went on to personally coach hundreds if not thousands
                     of clients through inner and outer transformation, and now utilizes his other areas of expertise including
                      Astrology, Intuitive Tarot Guidance, and Energy Healing to work with individuals to drastically change the 
                      direction of their life and help them find inner clarity, purpose, and true happiness/fulfillment in ways 
                      they could only imagine before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brandon is also passionate about motivational speaking, holistic health and spiritual education, and sharing
                     guidance on his Youtube Channel and Podcast, Science of the Soul and Stars. His dream is to travel the
                      World impacting the lives of millions while speaking publicly and hosting educational seminars about:

                        <p>When it comes to your health, most of us have relied solely on the “Western Medical” approach as a solution
                        to our issues. We have been convinced that we NEED a doctor, medication, or sometimes even surgery to intervene
                        if we are ever able to be healthy. That without these interventions, we are at a dire risk of sickness or disease. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        What I’ve discovered in my journey is this simply isn’t true. We all contain a naturally-gifted ability to heal ourselves.
                        </p>
