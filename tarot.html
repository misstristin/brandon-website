                    Brandon’s journey with the Tarot began a few years after studying Astrology. After working with client
                    s exclusively around their Natal Birth Chart, one day he was introduced to the “Wild Unknown” Tarot Deck
                     from a good friend, who allowed him to do some “practice readings” for her for fun. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After realizing he was “spot on” about his friend’s situation despite not knowing anything about it,
                     and relying solely on Tarot, he knew he had to learn more about this special practice. He soon began
                      studying and mastering the identities of the cards for himself. Now he utilizes it as a necessary
                       adjunct in sessions for clients to provide any immediate guidance or insight around particular
                        situations in love and in life.

                            In a recent tarot card reading session with Brandon I was feeling open to the experience and ready for
                             anything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sure enough this reading spoke to an inner conflict I had been feeling for sometime — The kind 
                            that you want to pretend is not there but you know deep down is actually there. It was an area in my
                             life where I had some fear, uncertainty, and confusion. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, the reading that Brandon channeled connected me back to a place of clarity because
                             it encouraged me to trust my intuition. Deep down I really did know the answer, It was a
                              matter of trusting it because it was asking me to grow. To grow into a place of increased self-worth,
                               self-respect, and self-confidence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m so incredibly grateful to Brandon for the bridge that he created between me and my Higher Self.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The impact this reading had on my life I almost can’t be put into words — trusting ourselves,
                             our Inner Wisdom, with big decisions is everything and this reading helped me to remember just
                              how right on my intuition really is!
