                    Brandon’s Health journey began in 2012 when he was diagnosed with over 5 different “incurable” health
                     disorders during his College Career as a former Division 1 Athlete. Most notably, he was suffering from
                      Anxiety/Panic Attack Disorder, Eczema/Psoriasis, Bouts of Depression, Hypertension, and Sleep Apnea,
                       among others.  After listening to the “best” that western medical doctors could advise (nothing but
                        several different prescription medications and blaming “genetics” for the apparently “lifelong” ailments,)
                         he decided to take his health into his own hands.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within 3-6 months of committing himself to learning about Biology, Physiology, the Nervous System, as well
                     as ancient medical practices such as Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine, he was able to lose 35+pounds of fat,
                      completely solve his eczema and sleep apnea, drastically reduce his anxiety and solve his depression.
                       To this day, after 8+ years of studying and practicing as a Certified Performance Coach, High Tech Wellness
                        Consultant, and Lead Health Strategist for some of the top Regenerative Clinics in the U.S., he still works
                         1 on 1 with clients to help provide strategies and solutions for chronic and debilitating health issues in
                          the U.S.

                    <li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    I believe health is one of the most powerful vehicles we have to fulfill our greatest purpose in life...and to
                     enjoy the process! It is a gift not to be taken for granted or wasted. It also helps us on our Spiritual Journey!

                            Brandon has a way of tuning in with both heart and respect to help uncover who you truly
                             are beneath it all. My healing sessions with him are deeply personal and leave me feeling
                              more grounded and assured. His deeply intuitive wisdom has shifted my perspective for the
                               better and I feel more secure in my decision making as a result of his work.
